Welcome to this learning Rust series where we will learn Rust by building one project per article and learn each and every concept in quite some depth. This is my new Rust series and it'll much more comprehensive than my previous Rust series. For the first 5-6 articles, the projects will be relatively simple but after that I assure you, we are going to build a ton of interesting projects and learn a lot of stuff. So, lets start with the first article
![[rust-01.png]]

In this article, we are going to learn about Rust variables and types by building a simple scientific calculator.
## Prerequisites
You should know any one programming language at least the basics of it like conditions, variables, loops, functions. *The most important thing, you should have will to learn and put effort*. This is going to be a long but tough journey so buckle up.

## Part 1 - Installing Rust
Just like any other language, we first need to install it before we can use it, so just go ahead and follow the Rust installation instruction and come back [Install Rust with rustup](https://www.rust-lang.org/tools/install?utm_source=chatgpt.com)

After installing Rust, open a new terminal and check that the compiler is available:
```bash
rustc --version
```

You should see a version similar to:
```text
rustc 1.97.0
```

The exact version will depend on when you install Rust.

Now check Cargo:
```bash
cargo --version
```

You may be thinking **what is Cargo?** Cargo is Rust's build system and package manager. We will use Cargo throughout this series.

You can also check rustup:
```bash
rustup --version
```

If all three commands work, your Rust installation is ready.

# Getting Started with Cargo

Before we start learning Rust, let's quickly understand how we will create, build, and run our Rust projects throughout this series.

## What is Cargo?

Cargo is Rust's build system and package manager. It handles tasks such as creating projects, compiling code, running programs, checking code, and managing dependencies.

You will be using Cargo throughout this series, so let's get familiar with the basic commands.

## Creating a Rust Project

Let's create our first Rust project.

Open your terminal, navigate to the folder where you want to keep your project, and run:

```bash
cargo new hello-rust
```

Cargo will create a new directory called `hello-rust` with a basic Rust project inside it.

Move into the project:

```bash
cd hello-rust
```

If you open the project in your editor, you will see a structure similar to this:

```text
hello-rust/
├── Cargo.toml
└── src/
    └── main.rs
```

Let's understand what these files are.

`Cargo.toml` is the project's manifest file. It contains information about the project, such as its name, version, Rust edition, and dependencies.

`src/main.rs` is the entry point of a binary Rust application. This is where our `main` function will live.

Cargo also creates a `Cargo.lock` file after resolving dependencies during a build. You don't need to worry about it yet; we'll discuss dependency management later in the series.

## Running the Project

Open `src/main.rs`. Cargo generates a small Hello World program for us:

```rust
fn main() {
    println!("Hello, world!");
}
```

We can run the program with:

```bash
cargo run
```

You should see:

```text
Hello, world!
```

`cargo run` first compiles the project if necessary and then runs the resulting executable.

## Checking Your Code

Another useful command is:

```bash
cargo check
```

`cargo check` checks whether your project compiles without producing the final executable.

It is useful while developing because it lets you quickly check whether your code is valid without doing a complete build.

You will see me use `cargo check` frequently throughout this series.

## Building Your Project

To compile the project, you can use:

```bash
cargo build
```

By default, this creates a debug build. When you eventually want an optimized release build, you can use:

```bash
cargo build --release
```

For now, you don't need to worry about the difference between debug and release builds. We'll come back to that when it becomes relevant.

## The Cargo Workflow

At this point, the basic workflow you need to remember is:

```text
cargo new       → create a new project
cargo check     → check that the code compiles
cargo run       → compile and run the program
cargo build     → compile the project
```

That's enough Cargo knowledge for now.

We will learn more about Cargo, dependencies, workspaces, builds, and project configuration later in the series when we actually need them.

Now that we know how to create and run a Rust project, let's start learning Rust itself.
## Part 2 - Variables
The very first thing that we will learn is **variables in Rust**. The syntax is very similar to other programming languages but still there are some differences that you should know and understand from the very beginning.
### Creating a Variable
Let's start by learning how to create a variable:
```rust
fn main() {
	let number = 10;
	
	println!("{number}")
}
```
You can run this by typing the following in your terminal:
```bash
cargo run
```
You should see the output `10`. The line `let number = 10;` creates a variable binding. Let me show you with the following image:

![[Screenshot 2026-08-23 at 05.52.56.png]]
In Rust terminology, it is useful to think of `let` as creating a **binding** between a name and a value. Here, we are basically telling Rust that the name `number` refers to the value `10`. Don't worry about the types right now, we will learn about them shortly

Now you might be thinking that it seems very very similar to languages like JavaScript and Python, then what is the difference that I was talking about. Let me show you by explaining what are the pieces of information associated with binding:
![[Screenshot 2026-08-23 at 06.05.43.png]]
For now, you just need to note that the binding has a name called `number` and it refers to a value `10`, the value has a type, the binding is immutable by default and the binding exists within a particular scope. We will comeback to these properties later in this section and the next one as well.
## Variables are immutable by default
Lets try and run this program:
```rust
fn main() {
    let number = 10;

    number = 20;

    println!("{number}");
}
```

You will see an error saying we cannot assign to an immutable variable.
> You need to remember this: bindings created with `let` are immutable by default

If we want to change the value associated with the binding, we have to explicitly say that it is mutable and we do that by using the keyword `mut`:

```rust
fn main() {
    let mut number = 10;

    number = 20;

    println!("{number}");
}
```

Now run the program using `cargo run` and you'll see the output `20`. 
> For now, that distinction is enough. Ownership and borrowing will make this distinction much more important later in the series.
### Reassignment
Let's try and run this program:
```rust
fn main() {
	let mut number = 10l
	
	number = 20;
	number = 30;
	
	println!("{number}")
}
```
You'll get the output `30`. We first create the binding `number` with value `10`, then reassigned to `20` and then again reassigned to `30` and finally print `number`

### Shadowing
In Rust, we can declare another binding using the same name, like this:
```rust
fn main() {
	let number = 10;
	let number = 20;
	
	println!("{number}")
}
```
Now, run and check the output, you'll get the output `20`. At first, this may seem like reassignment but its not. This is what we call `shadowing`. There is a subtle difference between reassignment and shadowing, in shadowing you can see that the second `let` creates a new binding that has the same name as the previous binding. In reassignment, we don't create multiple binding with the same name.

Shadowing can also change the type as well:
```rust
fn main() {
	let value = 10;
	let value = "ten";
	
	println!("{value}")
}
```
If you'll run this, you can see the output will be `ten`. If you'll do this using reassignment, then it would fail and will show you an error:
```rust
fn main() {
	let mut value = 10;
	value = "ten";
	
	println!("{value}")
}
```
This shadowing concept will be used later in our series, so for now I'm leaving this concept here and we will pick it up in a later article to learn even more about it.

### Scope
These bindings also have a scope. Scope is the region of the program in which the binding can be used. Let me show you with an example:
```rust
fn main() {
	let outer = 10;
	
	{
		let inner = 20;
		println!("{outer}")
		println!("{inner}")
	}
	
	println!("{outer}")
}
```
I think you must have seen this kind of scope in other languages as well. The inner binding scope only exists inside the nested block and outer binding scope exists till the end of the program. So when you run the program, once our program gets out of the nested block, the `inner` binding is no longer available. That's why if you'll try to print `inner` binding value outside of that nested block, you'll get an error. Let me show you the scope of our above code with this visual:
![[Screenshot 2026-08-23 at 06.43.06.png]]
We will later understand and connect the idea of scoping with ownership and lifetime, but for now, just understand that scope is a region in which a binding is available

### Where does the value actually live?
I know you may be wondering what actually happens when we write `let number = 10;` in a Rust program. I can give you a brief explanation now but we will dive deeper in a later article regarding this. 

So, for simple values such as integers, the compiler can generally represent the value directly in machine storage often in a register or stack memory depending on how the generated code is optimised and used. 
> Variables are not always live on the stack. Please take the above brief statement with a pinch of salt as I'm simplifying this a lot. As I said, we will learn about this in detail in a separate article, so it would be great if you'll be patient and for now just focus on learning the language level behaviour and not focus on machine level details.

### One Last Experiment
Let's just combine what we have learned with this program:
```rust
fn main() {
	let number = 10;
	
	{
		let mut number = number;
		
		number = 20;
		
		println!("{number}");
	}
	
	println!("{number}")
}
```
I would say try to guess the output first before running the program and checking the output. First, we created a outer binding `number` and the value is `10`, then inside the nested block, we created an inner binding with the same name, this will shadow the outer `number` binding and the value of this inner binding is `10`, then we are reassigning the value to be `20`(we can do this because of `mut` in inner binding), then printing `number` would give us `20`. Finally we exist out of nested block and prints `number` again but this time it'll point to the outer `number` binding, hence printing the value `10`.

I think, by now you should be comfortable with the basic variable model. Now, we can get into types

## Part 4 - Types
Like some other languages, we have types in Rust as well. Let's use the same example that we used first and look at the value itself:
```rust
let number = 10;
```
We know that the `number` refers to `10` but the question is *What kind of value if 10?* This is where we will focus for the rest of the section where we will understand all the common types that Rust provides.

In general, a type tells us what kind of value it is working with and what operations are valid for that value.

Let's start with a very basic example:
```rust
fn main() {
	let number = 10;
	
	println!("{number}")
}
```
Once you run it, you'll see the output `10`. We already know this, nothing surprising. Now, lets make its type explicit:
```rust
fn main() {
	let number: i32 = 10;
	
	println!("{number}")
}
```
This will again output `10` but in this program, we explicitly mentioned that type the value should have.

The syntax that you'll follow to explicitly mention the type of a value is this:
```rust
let name: Type = value;
```
So in our basic example, `number` is the binding name, `i32` is the type and `10` is the value

### What Does a Type Actually Determine?
A type determines things like what values can be represented, how operations on those values behave, which operations are valid, how values can interact with other values, how the compiler represents the value at runtime and may be something else but I think these are the most common things you should know
For example, integers support operations arithmetic operations:
```rust
fn main() {
	let a: i32 = 10;
	let b: i32 = 20;
	
	let result = a + b;
	
	println!("{result}");
}
```
This works because `i32` supports addition. But Rust does not allow arbitrary values of unrelated types to be combined. For example:
```rust
fn main() {
	let a: i32 = 10;
	let b: f64 = 20.5;
	
	let result = a + b;
	
	println!("result")
}
```
If you'll run this, this will fail because Rust will see two different types `i32` and `f64` and the compiler will complain saying both are not the same type so can't perform operation. We will later see how to convert a type to make this operation happen but for now just remember that performing operations on different types will fail in Rust.

### Rust's Scalar Types
In Rust, we have some primitive scalar types. The four main categories are:

| Scalar Types           |
| ---------------------- |
| Integers               |
| Floating-point numbers |
| Booleans               |
| Characters             |
The integer and floating-point categories contain multiple concrete types. Let's go over each of these types and understand a bit more about each of these types one by one

### Signed Integers
A signed integer can represent both positive and negative whole numbers. In Rust, we have several variants of signed integers, these variants represents the size of the integer in bits.

| Signed Integers |
| --------------- |
| `i8`            |
| `i16`           |
| `i32`           |
| `i64`           |
| `i128`          |
| `isize`         |
We have different variants of signed integers because programs sometimes need different numeric ranges. For example, `i8` has 8 bits and can represent `-128 through 127` while `i32` has 32 bits and can represent `-2,147,483,648 through 2,147,483,647` and `i64` can represent even more. I hope you get the idea. 

### Unsigned Integers
A unsigned integer (yeah, you guessed it right) can't represent negative values. For example:
```rust
fn main() {
	let count: u32 = 100;
	
	println!("{count}");
}
```
This will work perfectly fine but if you'll replace that `100` with any negative number like this:
```rust
fn main() {
	let count: u32 = -100;
	
	println!("{count}")
}
```
Now, if you'll try to run it, compiler will complain because the range of `u8` is `0 through 255` and that's why negative numbers are not valid.

### `usize` and `isize`
There are two integer types that I want you to give your special attention: `usize` and `isize`. Unlike `i32` or `u64`, their size depends on the target architecture. For example, on a 64-bit system: `usize` is 64 bits and `isize` is 64 bits but on a 32-bit system: `usize` is 32 bits and `isize` is 32 bits. `usize` is very commonly used when working with sizes and indexes. You'll frequently see ti later when we work with collections. We will see the usage of `usize` in a later article, for now I just want you to understand the gist of it and I hope you do.

### Floating Point Types
As we are building a mini scientific calculator, we obviously need decimal value support and to support that Rust provides two floating-point types: `f32` and `f64`
Let me show you a basic example for floating point as well:
```rust
fn main() {
	let a: f32 = 10.5;
	let b: f64 = 20.5;
	
	println!("{a}");
	println!("{b}");
}
```

### Boolean
Rust supports boolean type as well and its represented with `bool`. It has exactly two possible values: `true` and `false`. Let me give you a basic example:
```rust
fn main() {
	let is_running: bool = true;
	let is_finished: bool = false;
	
	println!("{is_running}");
	println!("{is_finished}");
}
```

### Character
Rust also supports character type and its represented by `char` keyword. A `char` represents a single Unicode scalar value. For example:
```rust
fn main() {
	let letter: char = 'R';
	let symbol: char = '😀';
	
	println!("{letter}");
	println!("{symbol}");
}
```
Remember that, we are using single quotes when we are defining a character. If you'll use double quotes, then it'll become a string literal. These two are different types.

So, from the above example, you can see that a Rust `char` can represent Unicode scalar values and this is the reason you should not think of `char` as "one byte". Rust's `char` is a four-byte type representing a Unicode scalar value.

### Type Inference
In the beginning, we were not writing types for our variables but recently we started explicitly mentioning the types of our variables. That means, Rust does not require us to annotate every variable, Rust will infer the type and this is called **type inference**. 
Type inference doesn't mean that a variable has not type. that variable still has a concrete compile-time type. Its just that Rust has simply determined that type for us. We can also verify this theory with an example:
```rust
fn main() {
	let number = 10;
	
	println!("{}", std::any::type_name_of_val(&number));
}
```
You should see the output as `i32`.

### Numeric Literal Suffixes
Rust allows us to attach a type suffix to a numeric literal. This is just another way of making type explicit.
```rust
fn main() {
	let a = 10_i32;
	let b = 10_i64;
	let c = 10.5_f64;
}
```
The suffix tells Rust what type the literal should have. So, `10_i64` means the integer literal `10` should have type `i64`. The first way that we learned uses type annotation on the binding and this one uses a type suffix on the literal.

### Rust Does Not Implicitly Convert Numeric Type
Let's go back to the example that we used earlier:
```rust
fn main() {
	let a: i32 = 10;
	let b: f64 = 20.5;
	
	let result = a + b;
	
	println!("{result}");
}
```
If you'll run this, this will fail because you are trying to do operation with two different types. To make it run successfully, we need to convert one of these two types and make both the types same:
```rust
fn main() {
	let a: i32 = 10;
	let b: f64 = 20.5;
	
	let result = a as f64 + b;
	
	println!("{result}");
}
```
With that `as f64`, we converted the integer `a` to `f64` and now the operation can happen. We will learn more about type conversion later in the series. 

## Building The Scientific Calculator
From now on, we are going to build our calculator incrementally. I hope you have installed Rust already, if not please go to the top of this article and get the Rust installation link and follow the instructions. Once done, come back and start working on this project.

### Create the project
Just open your terminal, go to your preferred folder where you want to create this project and then lets create a new Cargo project:
```bash
cargo new scientific-calculator
```
Then open this project in your preferred IDE. I'll be using [Zed IDE](https://zed.dev/)
Once you open the project, you'll see this folder structure:
```
scientific-calculator/
├── Cargo.toml
└── src/
    └── main.rs
```
For this project, we don't need to modify `Cargo.toml` as we will only use Rust's standard library

Now, open `src/main.rs` and you'll see there is a Cargo generated hello world program, let's replace that and print `Scientific Calculator`:
```rust
fn main() {
	println!("Scientific Calculator");
}
```
Once you run it with `cargo run`, you should see `Scientific Calculator` on your terminal.

### Add the Four Basic Operations
Let's add all the four basic arithmetic operations:
```rust
fn main() {
    let a: f64 = 20.0;
    let b: f64 = 6.0;

    let addition = a + b;
    let subtraction = a - b;
    let multiplication = a * b;
    let division = a / b;

    println!("Addition: {addition}");
    println!("Subtraction: {subtraction}");
    println!("Multiplication: {multiplication}");
    println!("Division: {division}");
}
```
If you'll run this, you'll see that all the operations are working fine but formatting for division is missing. We will deal with that later.

### Add our First Scientific Operation
Lets add square root, power, trigonometric operations:
```rust
fn main() {
    let a: f64 = 20.0;
    let b: f64 = 6.0;

    let addition = a + b;
    let subtraction = a - b;
    let multiplication = a * b;
    let division = a / b;

    let square_root = 25.0_f64.sqrt();
    let power = 2.0_f64.powi(8);
    let sine = 0.0_f64.sin();
    let cosine = 0.0_f64.cos();

    println!("Addition: {addition}");
    println!("Subtraction: {subtraction}");
    println!("Multiplication: {multiplication}");
    println!("Division: {division}");
    println!("Square root: {square_root}");
    println!("Power: {power}");
    println!("Sine: {sine}");
    println!("Cosine: {cosine}");
}
```
Now, its looking a bit better but there is still one problem, the inputs are hardcoded, we need a way to take input from user. Let's work on that next.

### Reading Command Line Arguments
To read user inputs, we can read command line arguments and Rust provides `std::env::args` for accessing the arguments passed to a program. For now, lets not worry about parsing numbers or performing calculations. Lets first look at what are we receiving from the arguments through command line:
Comment out the complete `main.rs` code and then write this code:
```rust
fn main() {
	let args = std::env::args();

    println!("{:?}", args);
}
```
Now run:
```bash
cargo run -- add 10 20
```
You should see output representing the arguments passed to the program. However, `args` is an iterator, and printing it directly isn't particularly useful for our purposes. Let's collect the arguments into a vector:
> Don't worry if you don't understand things like iterator or vector, we will learn about these later. Here, we are just using them to get user input. The main goal of this article is for you to understand about variables and types and that's already done at this point. 

```rust
fn main() {
    let args: Vec<String> = std::env::args().collect();

    println!("{args:?}");
}
```

Run:
```bash
cargo run -- add 10 20
```

You should see something similar to:
```bash
["target/debug/scientific-calculator", "add", "10", "20"]
```
The exact first value will depend on your environment.

The important part is:
```bash
"add"
"10"
"20"
```
These are the arguments that we supplied.

### Why There's a `--`?
You may have noticed that we're running the program like this:
```bash
cargo run -- add 10 20
```
The `--` separates Cargo's arguments from our program's arguments. Everything before `--` is interpreted by Cargo. Everything after `--` is passed to our program.

So:
```bash
cargo run -- add 10 20
```

means:
```bash
Cargo
  |
  └── run the program
          |
          ├── "add"
          ├── "10"
          └── "20"
```

### Accessing Individual Arguments
We can access individual elements of the collected arguments using an index.

Change the program to:
```rust
fn main() {
    let args: Vec<String> = std::env::args().collect();

    println!("Operation: {}", args[1]);
    println!("First value: {}", args[2]);
    println!("Second value: {}", args[3]);
}
```

Run:
```bash
cargo run -- add 10 20
```

You should get:
```bash
Operation: add
First value: 10
Second value: 20
```

> Why do we start at `args[1]` instead of `args[0]`? Because the first argument, `args[0]`, is the program's executable name or path.


![[Screenshot 2026-08-24 at 16.16.51.png]]

### Parsing the numbers
We are able to get the operation that user wants to perform and the values but the problem is the values are coming as string from command line, we need to convert them to numbers to perform any mathematical operations. To parse, we can do something like this:
```rust
fn main() {
    let args: Vec<String> = std::env::args().collect();

    let a = args[2].parse::<f64>().unwrap();
    let b = args[3].parse::<f64>().unwrap();

    let result = a + b;

    println!("{result}");
}
```
Run it and you should see `30` as output. Now the remaining work we need to do is bring back those operations that we commented out previously and use conditions to choose which operation to perform.

### Choosing the Operation
Till now, we can get the operation that user wants to execute and the values in floating-point type. We are going to use conditionals in Rust, I'm not going to dive deep into conditions right now but we will use basic if-else block in this project so no need to worry.
```rust
fn main() {
    let args: Vec<String> = std::env::args().collect();

    let operation = &args[1];

    if operation == "add" {
        let a = args[2].parse::<f64>().unwrap();
        let b = args[3].parse::<f64>().unwrap();

        println!("{}", a + b);
    } else if operation == "subtract" {
        let a = args[2].parse::<f64>().unwrap();
        let b = args[3].parse::<f64>().unwrap();

        println!("{}", a - b);
    } else if operation == "multiply" {
        let a = args[2].parse::<f64>().unwrap();
        let b = args[3].parse::<f64>().unwrap();

        println!("{}", a * b);
    } else if operation == "divide" {
        let a = args[2].parse::<f64>().unwrap();
        let b = args[3].parse::<f64>().unwrap();

        println!("{}", a / b);
    } else if operation == "sqrt" {
        let value = args[2].parse::<f64>().unwrap();

        println!("{}", value.sqrt());
    } else if operation == "pow" {
	    let base = args[2].parse::<f64>().unwrap();
	    let exponent = args[3].parse::<i32>().unwrap();
	
	    println!("{}", base.powi(exponent));
    } else if operation == "sin" {
        let value = args[2].parse::<f64>().unwrap();

        println!("{}", value.sin());

        let value = args[2].parse::<f64>().unwrap();

Ok, this seems a lot of lines of code but we are only using a lot of if-else blocks, that's all. Its very similar to other languages, so I'm not explaining anything. But to summarise, we are receiving the operation that user wants to execute, then we use a bunch of if-else blocks to check which block satisfies the operation and then in that block, we are reading the values from command line and performing the operation and printing the result. 

> We are reading values inside every block so that we can simply decide which operation requires how many values for example square root requires only one value but addition requires two

Now test them:
```bash
cargo run -- sqrt 25
```

```
5
```

```bash
cargo run -- sin 0
```

```
0
```

```bash
cargo run -- cos 0
```

```
1
```


There you go, we just finished building our mini scientific calculator in Rust. If you want to experiment further, try adding a few more operations yourself. You could add `tan`, `log`, or anything else you think would be useful.

And if you're following along and build the calculator yourself or make any interesting modifications, feel free to tag me on X. I'd love to see what you build and will repost most of them as a small gesture of appreciation for following along with the series.

In the next article, we'll learn about **control flow in Rust** by building a **number guessing game**. See you in the next one.
